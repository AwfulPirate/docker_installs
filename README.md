# docker_installs
Docker and Docker-Compose install scripts for various linux distros and versions

## I got tired of running individual commands all the time, so I created some scripts to make this very easy. 

1. Download the .sh file for your Linux Distro and version.(or copy the contents to a script file)
2. Run the script using the syntax `. ./<filename>.sh`
3. Ensure there were no errors, and log out / back in, or reboot to have your user added to the docker group so you don't have to use sudo for everything.

If you find issues, or would like to contribute a script for a distro or version not already listed, please create a pull request with details.
